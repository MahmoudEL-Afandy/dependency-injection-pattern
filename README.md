## Dependency Injection Pattern 
 - **Dependency Injection Pattern**: Dependency Injection is a design pattern commonly used in software development to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) by injecting dependencies into a class rather than having the class create the dependencies itself.    
 - **Dependency Injection Pattern Goals**:
   - To promote loose coupling between classes by removing the dependency creation responsibility from the class itself.
   - To improve the testability, maintainability, and flexibility of software components.
     
 - **Dependency Injection Pattern Key Concepts**: 
  - Dependency: A class or service that another class relies on to perform its functionality.
  - Client Class: The class that requires the dependency to function properly.
  - Injector/Container: The component responsible for injecting dependencies into client classes.

  - **Types of Dependency Injection**:
    - Constructor Injection:
      - Dependencies are provided through the constructor of the class.
      - Ensures that dependencies are available when the object is instantiated.
    - Setter Injection:
      - Dependencies are provided through setter methods of the class.
      - Allows flexibility in setting dependencies after the object is created.
    - Interface Injection:
      - Classes implement an interface that defines methods for injecting dependencies.
      - Provides a standardized way of injecting dependencies into classes.
      
- **Benefits Of Dependency Injection**: 
 - Decoupling: Reduces the dependencies between classes, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
 - Testability: Facilitates unit testing by allowing mock objects or stubs to be injected for testing.
 - Flexibility: Allows for easy replacement of dependencies without modifying the client class.
 - Reusability: Promotes the reuse of components as dependencies can be easily switched out.
   
- **Dependency Injection Containers**: 
  - Frameworks: Dependency Injection containers like Spring (Java), Unity (.NET), Dagger (Android), and others manage the injection of dependencies.
  - Configuration: Dependencies are typically configured in a central location and injected into classes based on their requirements.

    
- **When to Use Dependency Injection**:
  - When aiming for decoupled and maintainable code.
  - When testing and mocking dependencies for unit tests.
  - When implementing Inversion of Control (IoC) principles in software design.


## Summary

- Dependency Injection is a powerful pattern that helps in creating modular, flexible, and testable software components by managing the dependencies between classes effectively.
